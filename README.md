# Gearfit-Pro
Scanner for determining helmet size Schuberth

## Project Context ##
Gear Central is a company dedicated to selling motorcycle and bicycle equipment. The project involved developing a mechatronic scanning system for measuring human heads with the aim of determining the best fit for Schuberth brand motorcycle helmets. The prototype was presented to the company at an engineering event and demonstrated under real-world conditions.

## Technical Contributions ##
- Programmed the system’s sensors and actuators for coordinated scanning operation.
- Designed and implemented the electrical wiring architecture and power distribution system.
- Proposed and integrated Time-of-Flight (ToF) sensors mounted on a rotating mechanism around the user’s head.
- Developed a measurement approach to estimate helmet size based on the calculated arc length obtained from rotational distance data.
